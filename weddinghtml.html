                <p>Maxx is my older brother and has been my best friend my entire life. Luck of the draw I know, but he's always had my back and been there when I needed him. I have lived with him on two coasts, been completely broke with him, been flush, partied all night, worked long hours, and a hundred other things. When I think back on my best memories he is there for a lot of them and will continue to be. I couldn't ask for a better person to be my Best Man.</p>

                  <p>After a certain amount of time, for better or worse, people can’t help being family. I met Chip 25 years ago and he has been a part of my life ever since. Wherever we are in the world he’s one of the people I reach out to, sharing my victories and my losses. We grew up together from, playing with toys, first dates, starting college, moving out on our own, and now starting our own families, Chip has been there with me through it all.</p>
                  <p>If you had all the clothes that Chip has lost over the years, either his own or that were borrowed from me, you could dress the entire wedding party. Twice.</p>

                  <h3>Justin Allen <small>Groomsman</small></h3>
                  <p>I met Justin at Fresno State. You know how everyone has a friend who is "That guy?" Justin is my "That Guy" and I wouldn't have it any other way. He's been keeping me honest for the last 15 years and I have been trying to keep him out of trouble. Neither of us is always successful. Justin always keeps it real, because that's all he knows how to do. If you ask him for his opinion about something you'll never be disappointed.</p>
                  <p>I have seen the movie "Tombstone" with Justin probably 100 times. I have no good explanation for that, but it is an American classic.</p>

                  <p>Have you ever met someone and thought, "If I was a little friendlier, a little more humble, maybe a little more generous, I could be like them?" That's how I feel about Anthony. I was lucky enough to be introduced to him by some of his fellow Maderans more than a decade ago. The good times are getting a little mellower, but we've been having them ever since.</p>
                  <p>If Anthony gets excited about something you can't help but be excited too. Consider that a warning.</p>

                  <p>If you asked me to remember two things that happened in college where Nick wasn’t there, I could do it. I would run into trouble if you asked for a third thing. When I met Nick at 18, we both would have sworn we knew everything there was to know. That was not true. We managed to figure a lot of it out together and make a lot of great memories along the way, both back in school and in San Diego.</p>
                  <p>Nick Barker is kind of scared of spiders. Needless to say I have chased him while holding one.</p>

                 <h3>Radovan Pletka <small>Groomsman</small></h3>
                  <p>In my entire life I have only met one person who didn't love Radovan. I hate that person. You won't meet someone more outgoing or enthusiastic. He's the kind of guy who will put you in a better mood just by being around. We've been friends almost 20 years and he's been that way since I met him. I consider myself fortunate to have him as a friend.</p>
                  <p>He will deny it but I taught Radovan to swim. It happened way more recently than you would guess.</p>

                  <h3>Adam Hughes <small>Groomsman</small></h3>
                  <p>When Adam and I first met he actually complained to Nick and Nate that I was being mean to him. I don't let him forget that, but he managed to get over it and we've been friends ever since. I can think of a lot of times when I had to be the "voice of reason " for him, and a few where he has had to do it for me. We have had a lot of good times over the years and I am always glad that we will continue to have them.</p>
                  <p>You may hear people call Adam, "Hoss." If you hear someone call him "Hurricane Hoss," run away.</p>

                  <p>I've known Nate since the 90's and I can probably count on both hands the number of times I have seen him in a bad mood. Nate is another one of those people you can't help but love. His attitude is always infectious and he's the kind of guy you will always want around. Even as I think back about how different we all were as kids when we first met, all the qualities that make Nate a good guy and a great friend haven't changed.</p>
                  <p>All Nate and my arguments end with me asking him to cite his sources, then him telling me to shut up.</p>
