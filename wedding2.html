                            <p>Judie and Z. met in the fall of 2007 when Z. was hired at Digitaria as a project manager. Judie had just started a few weeks prior as the new receptionist. It would be nice to say that it was love at first sight, however, they unfortunately did not hit it off right away. If you asked Z., he would probably say that she had just never met anyone like him before. If you asked Judie she would probably say that she initially was just not that impressed. Luckily Z. is persistent or, at the very least, stubborn.</p>

                            <p>After several months of getting to know each other around the office, and a partially ignored "charm offensive" on the part of Z., the two of them started to hang out some outside of the office. We'd like pause here for a moment to acknowledge the role that Kate Gaffney, friend of the couple and member of the bridal party, played in making all this happen. If we didn't, she would never let us forget it. Basically, she and Z. were in cahoots.</p>
                            <p>During a celebration for his 28th birthday, Z. asked Judie on a date. A few days later, they went on their first date on the Ocean Terrace at George's at the Cove. At the time, it was the fanciest restaurant that Judie had ever been to. Within a month, they were officially a couple.  </p>

                            <p>Judie and Z. decided to make the leap and move in together. They got a lovely loft apartment in downtown San Diego after Z. had been living by the beach for more than six years. They were just two kids in love, and didn't manage to put anything up on the walls until about three months before they moved out. Z. quickly learned that the rice cooker always stayed on top of the counter and that sometimes Judie cleaning things is the same as misplacing things.</p>
                            <p>The happy couple also added a new member to the team when Z. bought Judie a puppy for her 24th birthday. After a rough first couple of nights, Zoli quickly became a part of the family. Judie and Zoli started to attend puppy classes at the humane society, mostly for Judie's sake. She wont admit it, but she was a little scared of an eight week old Zoli.</p>

                            <p>2010 was a big year. The happy couple made the big decision to move across the country to The Windy City. Why anyone would leave 70 and sunny for cold and windy is debatable, but Judie and Z. both made lists of cities they would like to live in and the lists didn't match. Luckily, Chicago just happened to be the perfect compromise.</p> 
                            <p>In August, they packed up everything they owned, threw Zoli in the front seat and got ready for a 2000 mile drive in a cherry red Ford Mustang listening to Katy Perry's Teenage Dream (while Z. was sleeping, of course!). Some of the highlights of that trip were seeing some amazing natural scenery, Zoli "smelling" a cactus, and sleeping in a Motel 6 in America's largest truck stop, where a murder had more than likely occurred.</p>

                            <p>Judie and Z. spent the start of the year wondering why they moved away from Southern California as they struggled to survive their first Midwest winter, otherwise known as 2011's Snowpocalypse. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwmLJRpb5p0" target="_blank">Zoli</a>, on the other hand, felt right at home as she (and Judie) discovered snow for the first time. As spring arrived though, they started to explore their new home.</p>

                            <p>At some point while all this had been happening over the last couple of years, Z. realized that he wanted it all to keep happening, forever. He found the perfect ring and waited until a day after Valentines Day to ask the question, because he just has to be different. He picked up Judie from school and brought her home to candles and champagne. While she was still trying to figure out what was happening he took the opportunity to ask her to marry him. He will never forget the way she looked confused and said, "I'm so sleepy," with her hands on her head or when he asked if that meant yes, she responded that yes, it did.</p>

                            <p>Now it's 2013 and we're getting married. We're heading back to San Diego to make it official on June 22nd and celebrating with the people we love. Right afterwards we'll probably go somewhere nice and just celebrate with each other.</p>

                        <p>Maxx is my older brother and has been my best friend my entire life. Luck of the draw I know, but he's always had my back and been there when I needed him. I have lived with him on two coasts, been completely broke with him, been flush, partied all night, worked long hours, and a hundred other things. When I think back on my best memories he is there for a lot of them and will continue to be. I couldn't ask for a better person to be my Best Man.</p>
                        <p>If you ask Maxx or I who is better at anything we will both answer, "I am." He is lying.</p>

                        <p>After a certain amount of time, for better or worse, people can’t help being family. I met Chip 25 years ago and he has been a part of my life ever since. Wherever we are in the world he’s one of the people I reach out to, sharing my victories and my losses. We grew up together from, playing with toys, first dates, starting college, moving out on our own, and now starting our own families, Chip has been there with me through it all.</p>
                        <p>If you had all the clothes that Chip has lost over the years, either his own or that were borrowed from me, you could dress the entire wedding party. Twice.</p>

                        <p>I met Justin at Fresno State. You know how everyone has a friend who is "That guy?" Justin is my "That Guy" and I wouldn't have it any other way. He's been keeping me honest for the last 15 years and I have been trying to keep him out of trouble. Neither of us is always successful. Justin always keeps it real, because that's all he knows how to do. If you ask him for his opinion about something you'll never be disappointed.</p>
                        <p>I have seen the movie "Tombstone" with Justin probably 100 times. I have no good explanation for that, but it is an American classic.</p>

That's how I feel about Anthony. I was lucky enough to be introduced to him by some of his fellow Maderans more than a decade ago. The good times are getting a little mellower, but we've been having them ever since.</p>
                        <p>If Anthony gets excited about something you can't help but be excited too. Consider that a warning.</p>

                        <p>If you asked me to remember two things that happened in college where Nick wasn’t there, I could do it. I would run into trouble if you asked for a third thing. When I met Nick at 18, we both would have sworn we knew everything there was to know. That was not true. We managed to figure a lot of it out together and make a lot of great memories along the way, both back in school and in San Diego.</p>
                        <p>Nick Barker is kind of scared of spiders. Needless to say I have chased him while holding one.</p>

He's the kind of guy who will put you in a better mood just by being around. We've been friends almost 20 years and he's been that way since I met him. I consider myself fortunate to have him as a friend.</p>
                        <p>He will deny it but I taught Radovan to swim. It happened way more recently than you would guess.</p>

I don't let him forget that, but he managed to get over it and we've been friends ever since. I can think of a lot of times when I had to be the "voice of reason " for him, and a few where he has had to do it for me. We have had a lot of good times over the years and I am always glad that we will continue to have them.</p>

Nate is another one of those people you can't help but love. His attitude is always infectious and he's the kind of guy you will always want around. Even as I think back about how different we all were as kids when we first met, all the qualities that make Nate a good guy and a great friend haven't changed.</p>
                        <p>All Nate and my arguments end with me asking him to cite his sources, then him telling me to shut up.</p>

During the beginning of our friendship, I had no idea she was working as a double agent for Z. That's just how good she is. Now she's in LA pursuing her dreams and I'm in Chicago pursuing mine. And when we get together, we pick up right where we left off... making funny Asian jokes.</p>

We had so much in common (middle name, last name, we both were manicurists), we started telling people we were related. We decided to become roomies in 2006 and lived together for a year. During that time, we've had plenty of fond memories, including the time we wore the cutest shoes to Tijuana and couldn't walk back to the car or once, we left the doctor's office with burnt fingers and were so pitiful, we started whining in Vietnamese. Good times.</p>

We both were notorious for running on Asian time, and even if we didn't like being punctual, we sure liked to have fun. We spent a lot of nights partying at Jeff's house (remember that?!), feasting on carna asada fries at late night burrito shops or hanging out at the beach. We don't see each other as often these days, mostly because she's in the Bay Area and I'm in the MidWest, but I know she'll be a life-long friend.</p>

It was definitely a heart-to-heart moment when he shared his wisdom with me. I will never forget the words he spoke because it really resonated: Don't get your meat, where you get your bread. And if anyone loves a good bargain, it's kChu. I almost had him help me with the wedding vendors.</p>
