                        <span class="data-story flow-text ">

Her Story: I was living in Memphis and went to a friends house for a small barbecue. When I arrived, all the ladies were hanging downstairs talking politics and the guys upstairs playing pool. Being apolitical and a terrible pool player, I decided best place for me would be to try to find any little ones to play with. I headed upstairs to the pool room where a friends’ kids were playing and noticed Dustin right away. I decided to join in the pool game and I remember him teasing me and grabbing the back of my cue stick as I was trying to take a shot. Conversation was easy from the beginning. He was a former army ranger, loved golf. Passionate and smart, kind and funny. I had to leave the party to go walk a dog but it wasn’t even a question that I wanted to see Dustin again after our brief meeting. So I did, that same night, we went and played more pool with our friends. I’m not sure we’ve played any pool since that first night but it was a great first meeting.

His Story: After a day on the golf course, in Memphis, TN, a friend of mine asked if I wanted to go to a BBQ with a bunch of his work friends. I like food, especially grilled food, so of course I said yes. The party was all married couples, but hey, at least the food was amazing. After a couple of hours there I noticed this beautiful woman playing with the kids in attendance. I naturally assumed she was married and that those were maybe even her children, so I went back to playing pool with some of the guys. Eventually, one of the guys very casually walked by, nudged me, and while nodding his head said “She’s single.” And then just kept walking. I wasn’t completely sure I had heard him correctly, but as the night continued on, and couples were heading home, it soon became clear that this woman had come alone. We started talking. The conversation was easy, interesting, and I soon realized I really liked her. She had to leave to go walk a colleagues dogs while they were away, and we exchanged phone numbers. Part of me assumed that would be the end of it, but lo and behold, she came back later that night and the hosts of the evening, myself, my friend, and Jenny went out to bar for an after-party. The great conversation continued, and we ended the night with a kiss that made me realize how much I liked this intriguing woman. We haven’t spent more than a few days apart since.

                        <span class="data-story flow-text ">
Dustin and I first met in June. Hope it Floats was in July that year. We met DURING Hope it Floats Planning Season. I’m not sure I can explain what this was like for a budding relationship. How could I tell this new man about something so important to me and taking all of my time in emails to plan, but not sound crazy when this ‘thing’ was a homemade raft race. What would he think? If he wasn’t excited about the idea, that could be a deal breaker. If he was excited, I would want to invite him. Then that meant introducing to all of my closest friends, family and strangers. I thought hard about it. I even emailed Anne for advice after only hanging out 2 times, “What if my first potential relationship in a very long time, was ended before it starts because of a premature Hope it Floats invite”. So I told him, I think it was our third date. We were eating at his country club and his reaction was more than I could hope for. He immediately started talking about plans and friends he would ask for help in planning. That night he came back to my apartment for a movie. I fell asleep and woke up to the man I will love for the rest of my life and that was the moment it started to click and I began to hope for what we are planning today. He had proudly constructed a boat out of cans and saran wrap. It also lead to our first disagreement over the perils of boat building with barrels...but I saved that for another night.

So it was set. Jenny and I were taking our first road trip together. 8 ½ hours sitting side by side. I remember it like it was yesterday. I didn’t know if I was more excited or anxious because not only was I going to see what this Hope It Floats thing was all about, but I was meeting Jenny’s parents, 3 older brothers and their wives (one of which is Jenny’s best friend from childhood), and most of her extended family and friends at the same time. 100 of Jenny’s nearest and dearest all putting me in the spotlight, because, you see, Jenny hadn’t really brought boyfriends around before. Luckily, the military had prepared me well for this type of situation. SERE came to mind- Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape.
Jokes aside, her family was amazing. They welcomed me from the second I walked through the door. Looking back, I can’t remember a time when the Cove didn’t feel like home, and well, that’s probably because from my very first visit, Jenny’s family made it home. My first Hope It Floats may go down as one of my favorite weekends of all time. Incidentally, that first year was the first time Jenny Feldman’s boat ever floated. Coincidence? I think not.

                            <span class="data-story flow-text ">
Only 6 mo into our relationship we were both planning for our next big steps in life. I was finishing my pediatric residency and he was graduating from University of Memphis and planning for law school. We decided together to take a leap. Even though the relationship was young we wanted to start the next journey together. So I began to look for jobs in the cities he was applying to law school in. It turned out his application process opened up more options than mine. He got into an excellent school in Washington DC and I was excited to move with him and be close to my nephew, brother and sister in law. When I wasn’t able to find a job, Dustin changed his plan without hesitation. His loyalty and support never waivered in those days. He called admissions at UC and was able to get his spot back after the deadline. I found position in Cincinnati and we said goodbye to our friends and life in Memphis, loaded up a U-Haul together and settled into our loft above the casket store for the next stage of our life.

                            <span class="data-story flow-text ">
July of 2014, Jenny and I had been together for two years. Daphne, the newest addition to the family, was fitting in perfectly, and I knew it was time to take the next step. I knew that I loved Jenny with all of my heart and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her; it was time to start shopping for a ring. How was I going to find a ring fitting for such a strong, independent, intelligent, and unique woman? I knew she wanted something out of the ordinary, a little different, but I knew nothing about diamonds. The search began. Online resources were great, but it wasn’t until I visited the local jewelers that I found out about black diamonds. From the moment I saw it, I knew it’s what I wanted to get for Jenny. It was unique, beautiful, and made a bold statement- all characteristics I felt perfectly summed up the woman I wanted to marry.  Now, that the ring was out of the way, I needed to ask her father for his blessing. Those of you who know Bob Feldman probably think of him as a pretty nice guy, but man, was I scared to start this conversation. We got caught in the barn one afternoon during the middle of a rainstorm, and I seized the opportunity. In true Feldman fashion, he made me feel great about the entire situation and we both walked away with smiles on our faces.
I walked around for a couple of weeks with the ring in my pocket before I asked Jenny to marry me. My goal was to wait and ask her at Hope it Floats, but I couldn’t wait that long. We took the dogs for a long walk across the river and as the sun was setting, with a view of Cincinnati as a backdrop, I couldn’t wait any longer. I got down on one knee and asked. Luckily, she said…….

Dustin and I are both dog lovers. There have been many dogs over the years that have stolen our hearts. Maybe none quite so much as Finnegan Fineus Finland. Dustin was so supportive when I lost my dear furry friend too soon; he was a true friend. It also helped having our other dog Nashville to comfort me, but Nashville has 2 homes and a very large family. I knew Dustin really wanted an all-the time dog for more lovin’, but was patient and waited until I was ready. I don’t think he expected it to take 16 months.
When we began searching for a new puppy, we visited the pound, went to events where dog shelters were set up, and searched exhaustively online. Finally, I think Daphne found us through the Cincinnati Pit Crew. Her first night she was so timid and very sweet. She’s not had a timid moment since. Her and Nashville were friends right away. Daphne has become a member of the family and brought Dustin and I even closer (though not physically as she prefers to always sit or sleep directly between us).

Wedding planning has been fun from the beginning. Dustin and I came to the idea of a combining our nuptials with Hope It Floats independently, both wondering if the other would really go for it. He brought it up to me at the end of Hope It Floats VIII weekend as we were leaving the cove, kind of as a joke, but feeling out the situation. I immediately and with fervor said YES! Then we decided we needed to wait a few weeks and bring it up again. We both recognized we were coming off a Hope It Floats high, if you’ve ever been, you know what I’m talking about. The more we talked about it and thinking of all the possibilities we knew it was the perfect way to celebrate. 

We have so many people who have helped make this process fun instead of stressful. My parents are hosting the big day for us at their home and our favorite place, The Cove and have been involved in every aspect of planning. If you haven’t been to the cove, I can’t wait for you to understand the joy this place brings us. It will be the perfect location to celebrate our life to come. Both of our families and friends have been instrumental in the planning of this day, everyone bringing their own expertise. From Pat building this amazing website, David making us smile for the camera, Ashley agreeing to officiate the ceremony, Emily organizing the bachelorrette party, and Scott helping us set up musicians to name just a few. We are both so grateful to our families and friends and can’t wait to celebrate with you all.
